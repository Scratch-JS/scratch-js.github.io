<h1 class="Muli">Scratch-js</h1>
<p class="Raleway">There are many people who start programing using Scratch but then get stuck because of the large leap from Scratch's easy to use Drag and Drop interface, to the typing and learning required in JavaScript. For example, many beginners will fall in love with Scratch. With Scratch they truly learn the fundamentals of Computer Science and Programming. The problem is that they eventually advance to the point were Scratch becomes to slow, and feature lacking for many things. That's where Scratch-JS comes in. Scratch-JS is a JavaScript library that focuses on easing the transition for beginner programmers from Scratch to JavaScript. With its easy to use, familiar and english like syntax from scratch; and the power, speed, accessibility and portability of JavaScript the best of both worlds can come together in one place. The best part is, the syntax, methods and properties of scratch will seem very familiar and easy to learn to anybody who has used scratch in the path.</>
